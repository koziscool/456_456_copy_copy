# User Stories: Navigation

## Site Navigation


**As a user navigating the site**

**I want to have convenient navigation links available at all times**

**So I can easily jump to various sections of the site**




- a navbar exists at the top of every page
- in the navbar:
    - there is a link to the root path
    - there is a link to artist listings
    - there is a link to user listings
    - there is a link to take the user to their own show page, `My Profile`
    - there is a link to logout
