# User Stories: Bookmarks

## Bookmarks


**As a user**

**I want to see a list of all a user's bookmarks**

**So I can go to the things that are bookmarked**




- on a user's SHOW page there is a bookmarks section that lists all that user's bookmarks
- each bookmark is a link that jumps the user to the SHOW page of that `bookmarkable`
- each bookmark has a button next to it `Remove bookmark` that deletes that bookmark
